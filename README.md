# Scheduler

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

A client-side web app that tracks time spent on specific tasks and organizes them with a tagging system. The app runs entirely in the user's browser; it has no server, and your private information is never transmitted over the internet. Task information is auto-saved to the browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage).

You can use it online, hosted on Github Pages [here](christopherfujino.github.io/scheduler).
